📌 Weekly Routine (Very Important)

Mon–Fri → Learn + solve

Saturday → Revise + re-solve weak problems

Sunday → Mock interview / mixed questions

📍 Platforms to Practice

LeetCode

CodeStudio (Coding Ninjas)

GeeksforGeeks

👉 Target: 150–180 problems in 3 months

🔥 Golden Rules (Follow these)

Don’t memorize solutions

Solve with pen & paper first

Stuck for 30 min? → see hint, not solution

Re-solve same question after 7 days
